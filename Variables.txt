What are Variables?
Variables are placeholders that store values.
In simple terms, a variable is a container that holds data inside it.

Example 1:
a = 6
b = 2
print(a + b)  # Output: 8

Example 2:
first_name = "Rupayan"
last_name = "Dutta"
print("My name is", first_name + " " + last_name)  # Output: My name is Rupayan Dutta

Important Notes:
i) Python is a case-sensitive language, meaning Name, name, and NAME are all different variables.
ii) Spaces are not allowed in variable names; use an underscore (_) instead (e.g., first_name).
iii)A variable name should never start with a number or special symbols.
