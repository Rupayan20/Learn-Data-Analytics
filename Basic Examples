Q2. How to print using multiple lines in Python?

Answer:
There are two methods to print statements on multiple lines in Python:

1. Triple Quotation Marks: Use triple quotes (`"""` or `'''`) to span the string over multiple lines.
2. Newline Character (`\n`): Use the `\n` character to insert a line break.

Q3. How to add comments in Python?

Answer:
Comments in Python are used to explain parts of the code. Python ignores comments.

1. Single-line Comment: Use `#` to start a single-line comment.
2. Multi-line Comment: Use triple quotes (`"""` or `'''`) to span comments across multiple lines.

Single-line comment example:
# print hello world
print("Hello World!")

Multi-line comment example:
"""
This is a multi-line comment example.
You can write explanations across multiple lines for better clarity.
"""

print("Good Morning Everyone. \nMyself Rupayan Dutta.")
